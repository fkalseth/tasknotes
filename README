Here's the initial version of my CQRS and event sourcing demo, 
where commands and events are all hooked up through an IOC container (Ninject2).

The frontend is an ASP.NET MVC 3 app. 
Stylesheets are SASS (compiled via Compass).

For now, the write-side persists to a simple xml file 
serializer (see XmlEventStorage), read-side to an 
in-memory dictionary (see TaskDtoRepository).

Will throw up some blogs (http://iridescence.no) 
explaining the particulars when I get time.
